# An Increasingly Sophisticated, Eventually Novel To-Do List
Goals:
- avoid complexity for it's own sake; each addition should be at least somewhat motivated.

### Phase 1: Just HTML (inline JS and CSS)
The initial, totally minimalist version of the project. The user enters an item in the input field, submits it to add it to the list, and can cross it out to show its completion, and/or remove it from the list


### Phase 2: The Standard Static Web App Project (HTML, CSS, JS files)

FUTURE TODO:
- remove submit button
- click anywhere to add list item
- click on list items to remove them
- click bin icon to view completed items
also add (maybe later):
- make pretty
- edit list items
- sub-bullets
- tags that apply to all children
### Phase 3: Create a backend (just an array object) and api, and refactor with React, Tailwind/Shadcn maybe, Typescript
- backend array object
- api
- test driven development
- design docs
- Docker containerization
### Phase 4: Implement a database backend with .Net
possibly: use .NET Minimal API with OAuth for the backend. Then a React application outside of the .NET solution for the frontend. 
Possibly: .net + react
also add:
-  a database 
-  a server
-  user accounts
### Phase 5: Make an HTTP Server with C to host it on
### Phase 6: AI?!?
add some AI bullshit. Maybe a context-based emoji suggestion for tagging things
### Phase 7: Make it novel, and ship it
