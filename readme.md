# An Increasingly Sophisticated, Eventually Novel To-Do List
Goals:
- avoid complexity for it's own sake; each addition should be at least somewhat motivated.

### Phase 1: Just HTML (inline JS and CSS)
The initial, totally minimalist version of the project. The user enters an item in the input field, submits it to add it to the list, and can cross it out to show its completion, and/or remove it from the list

FUTURE TODO:
- remove submit button
- click anywhere to add list item
- click on list items to remove them
- click bin icon to view completed items
### Phase 2: The Standard Web App Project (HTML, CSS, JS files)
also add (maybe later):
- make pretty
- edit list items
- sub-bullets
- tags that apply to all children
### Phase 3: Make it better, with React, Tailwind, and Shadcn (make it more like a text editor)
also add:
- test driven development
- design docs
### Phase 4: Implement a backend with .Net
also add:
-  a database 
-  a server
-  user accounts
-  an API
### Phase 5: Make an HTTP Server with C to host it on
### Phase 6: AI?!?
add some AI bullshit. Maybe a context-based emoji suggestion for tagging things
### Phase 7: Make it novel, and ship it
